# PJS4

## PJS4 is a computer science school project with free choice over the subject. We decided to make a 2D game without any game engine and we used LWJGL to make the bindings between OpenGL and Java. At the end the game is unachieved but a big part of the 2D rendering is achieved (Batch rendering, Dirty flags system, Spritesheet ...)
